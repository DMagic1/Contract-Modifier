//Included in this folder is a copy of the file: ContractModifierConfig.cfg
//This .cfg file is used to set the default values for all contract and parameter types
//A number of other options for the addon are also included

//The file MUST be in the following location: Kerbal Space Program/GameData/ContractRewardModifier/ContractRewardModifier.cfg

//The config file can be updated in-game by selecting the "Save To Config" button in the window

//In general it is better to set the values in-game and save them, rather than setting them by hand

//The following is an annotated copy of the config file; examples of contract and parameter types are included
